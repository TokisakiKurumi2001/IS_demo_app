Highly recommend that you have install virtualenv in your python environment. If you don't want to do it, it is fine anyway.

## Firstly install neccessary python package

```bash
pip install requirements.txt
```

## Run the user interface

```bash
python ui.py
```

## Interaction

Type some sentence you want to predict its sentiment and hit predict button. Wait for the answer. That's it.
